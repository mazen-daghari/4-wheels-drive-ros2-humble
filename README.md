4 wheels drive ros2 humble  based on nav2 

4WD Autonomous Rover - ROS 2 Humble (Nav2, LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU)
 A fully autonomous 4-wheel drive mobile robot designed for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and SLAM using ROS 2 Humble. This project integrates Nav2, LiDAR, depth camera, and IMU for robust autonomous movement.

 Features
 4WD Motion Control – Differential drive controller for smooth and precise movement
 Autonomous Navigation – Nav2 stack for path planning and obstacle avoidance
 SLAM & Mapping – Uses LiDAR and depth camera for real-time environment mapping
 Sensor Fusion – IMU for stable odometry and accurate localization
 Simulation & Real Deployment – Gazebo and physical robot support

 Hardware
Chassis: 4-wheel drive robotic base

Motors & Controllers: Supported via ROS 2 ros2_control

LiDAR: 360° scanning for SLAM & obstacle detection

Depth Camera: 3D perception for terrain and object recognition

IMU: Stabilization and orientation feedback

Compute: NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or x86-based PC
